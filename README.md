# Benchmarking Query Processors

I benchmarked DuckDB across different memory levels and threads using Python. This was a project for an Advanced Databases course.

## Running tests

Use `db_util.py` to run all tests. Resulting CSVs are in the `results` folder. Analysis, including `analyze.py` Python code for plot generation, is in the `analysis` folder.

## Project Report

See `report.pdf` for my project report.
